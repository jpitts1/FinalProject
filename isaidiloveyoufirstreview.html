<p>
    I Said I Love You First is a collaborative album between world renowned pop artist Selena Gomez, and mega-successful music producer, and her fiance, benny blanco. The engagement between has been making the rounds in not only the music world, but also pop culture, with everyone making their comments on. While I am happy for the two, the thing that I care the most about is the music. To promote this album, the pair released two singles. The lead single, which features the up and coming pop star, Gracie Abrams, is the song that has gotten the most play so far. If I have to be honest though, I must say, I'm not really feeling this album. I don't hate it, I just don't find anything special about it. To me, it seems like just your average, run of the mill pop record. And this is coming from someone who has enjoyed their music. A lot of the songs sound like the same song, which to me is fine, just as long as that one song is a great song. And it's not, it's ok at best. The features don't really make the album much better either. But hey, maybe it could just be me. If you're an avid pop music fan, then maybe you will enjoy this album.
