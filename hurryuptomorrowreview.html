    This is it. <em>Hurry Up Tomorrow</em> is the final studio album that Abel Tesfaye will be releasing under his stage name, The Weeknd. After feeling that he has fully explored everything that there is to explore, Abel will now be moving on from this name. <em>Hurry Up Tomorrow</em> is the third album in a trilogy that featured his 2020 LP <em>After Hours</em>, and his 2022 project, <em>Dawn FM</em>. To promote the project, The Weeknd released three singles, with the lead single being "Timeless" which features rapper Playboi Carti. This song is probably my favorite on the album. I've always enjoyed the futuristic vibes of The Weeknd's music. The way he blends pop with rap and R&B makes him, in my opinion, one of the most creative mainstream artists in music. He gives his in all in this last album, with big time features from artists such as Future, Lana Del Rey, and Travis Scott. And, one fun tidbit about this album, is that the last song on it (provided you tweak it a bit) loops back around to the first song that he ever did. So all in all, I think this was a really great album. While it will be sad to see him go, The Weeknd surely left a great catalogue of music behind him.
