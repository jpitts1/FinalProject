<h1>GNX by Kendrick Lamar</h1>

    Kendrick Lamar's 6th studio album comes following one of the biggest rap beefs in the history of the genre. Throughout the entirety of 2024, Kendrick and fellow rapper Drake have gone back and forth with back to back diss songs calling each other out in a number of allegations. The battle seemed to have ended after Kendrick Lamar dropped what would become his 5th number one hit song, "Not Like Us." The release of this album came very suddenly. Before the release, Kendrick dropped a teaser for the album, and soon the entire album was released right after. In my opinion, I would say that this album delivers on all fronts. If you were to take the hype sounds of <em>DAMN</em> and the brilliant story telling of <em>To Pimp A Butterfly</em>, you get GNX. This album is filled with fun, hard hitting bangers that are great for every situation. Songs like "luther", "squabble up" "peekaboo", and "tv off", show off the talents of Kendrick Lamar, as well as showcasing the talents of other artists as well. I think GNX is going to age greatly in terms of quality, and it'll be relevant for years to come.

<p>Final Score: 9/10</p>
