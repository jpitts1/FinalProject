<h2>Today's artist of the day is Sia!</h2>

<p id="firsttest">
    Out of the many pop artists of the last 10 years or so, I would say that Sia is differently one of my favorite. The first song that I had ever heard from her was Chandelier, as it was all over the radio when it was released. The impressive vocals in that song turned me into a fan right away. That, and her mysterious aura that she has, with the donning of the long wigs that cover her face. She's put out many hits since that album. She's even done her very own Christmas LP. She's been around for a while, having her start in 2001 with her album, <em>Healing Is Difficult</em>. In the early 2010s, she gained a lot of popularity for doing some high profiles features with artists like Flo Rida and David Guetta, who she just recently released a single with. If I had to recommend an album of hers, I would recommend her 2016 project, <em>This Is Acting</em>, which features big hits like Cheap Thrills and Unstoppable.
